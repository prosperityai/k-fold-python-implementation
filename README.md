# k-fold-python-cross validation
Cross-validation, sometimes called rotation estimation,is a model validation technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. It is mainly used in settings where the goal is prediction, and one wants to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice. In a prediction problem, a model is usually given a dataset of known data on which training is run (training dataset), and a dataset of unknown data (or first seen data) against which the model is tested (called the validation dataset or testing set).The goal of cross validation is to define a dataset to "test" the model in the training phase (i.e., the validation set), in order to limit problems like overfitting[citation needed], give an insight on how the model will generalize to an independent dataset (i.e., an unknown dataset, for instance from a real problem), etc.
